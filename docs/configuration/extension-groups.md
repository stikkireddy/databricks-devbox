# Extension Groups

Extension groups are pre-configured sets of VS Code extensions that can be quickly deployed to code-server instances.

## Overview

Extension groups allow you to:

- **Bundle related extensions** together (e.g., all Python tools)
- **Apply consistent settings** across servers
- **Quick setup** with pre-selected extensions
- **Reusability** across multiple servers

## Configuration

See the example `devbox.yaml` configuration in `app/devbox.yaml`.
